How to play the game
Use the arrow keys to move your player up, down, left, and right respectively.
The object of the game is to complete each level by reaching the water without getting hit by enemy bugs. This will level up the player until end of the game (twelfth level).
In this game there are twelve levels and five lives.
If the player collides with an enemy bug he loses one life and the player moves back to the initial position.
If the player collides with an enemy bug five times, he loses the game.
The player wins the game if he reaches the water 12 times without colliding with bugs.
